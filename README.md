# InterviewQuestionOfTheDay_FA19
COS 226 Precept P02 Fall 2019 - All Interview Questions of the Day (IQODs)

Each week, I'll post the solution to a common interview problem I've either encountered or given to candidates. I'll try and keep the list of problems below up to date!

- [validAnagrams](https://github.com/cdsciavolino/InterviewQuestionOfTheDay_FA19/blob/master/src/IQOD.java#L20) ([Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/)): Given two strings, return true iff they are [anagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram) and false otherwise.

- [validParentheses](https://github.com/cdsciavolino/InterviewQuestionOfTheDay_FA19/blob/master/src/IQOD.java#L54) ([Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/)): Given a string of parentheses, brackets, and braces, return true the expression is valid (i.e. all opening characters have the correct closing character). False otherwise.

- [simplifyFilePath](https://github.com/cdsciavolino/InterviewQuestionOfTheDay_FA19/blob/master/src/IQOD.java#L92) ([Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/simplify-path/)): Given an absolute file path, convert it to the shortest possible absolute file path that points to the same directory.

- [minWordTransform](https://github.com/cdsciavolino/InterviewQuestionOfTheDay_FA19/blob/master/src/IQOD.java#L143) ([Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder/): Given a start word, end word, and list of valid intermediate words, return the minimum length transformation to convert the start word one letter at a time into the end word using only valid intermediate words.

- [cheapestFlightsWithLayovers](https://github.com/cdsciavolino/InterviewQuestionOfTheDay_FA19/blob/master/src/IQOD.java#L218) ([Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/cheapest-flights-within-k-stops/)): Given the number of cities, a list of available flights, a start city, an end city, and a maximum number of layovers, find the cost of the cheapest flight sequence to get from the start city to the end city within the layover limit.
